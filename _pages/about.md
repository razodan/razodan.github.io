I am a graduate student in the Master's of Computer Science program at Utah Valley University. My current research, with Dr. Brian Knaeble, is concerned with residuals in high-dimensional multiple linear regression, and the application of those residuals to pruning decision trees.

Previously, I earned a Master's in Linguistics from University of Utah. My research then was focused on the form and meaning of aspectual adverbials such as *still*, *already*, *not anymore*, *not yet*, *again*, and *anew*, as well as their Spanish counterparts. The title of my thesis is "Spanish Aspectual Adverbials: Scales and Repetition".

My research interests include optimization of high-dimensional regression models, sentiment analysis for low-resource language varieties, causal AI, and ethical AI. For fun, I also dabble in Kalman filtering for microcontrollers, optimization with integer programming, elliptic curve cryptography, computer graphics and quaternions, as well as applications of fractal geometry and Hausdorff dimension.
